# Chin Tapak Dum Dum

Welcome to the official page of **Chin Tapak Dum Dum** – the most notorious (and hilarious) band of cricketing jailbirds you’ll ever meet! 🦹‍♂️🏏

## Who Are We?

We’re not just a team, we’re a full-blown prison break in cricket whites! Formed in the deepest dungeons of the CDS Fun Serious Group B, our squad is made up of the wildest, wittiest, and most mischievous “prisoners” ever to wield a bat or ball. Each member brings their own unique crime to the pitch—be it stealing singles, robbing boundaries, or committing the occasional wide.

## Our Mission

To bring chaos, laughter, and a little bit of cricketing anarchy to the CDS tournament. We play hard, laugh harder, and never miss a chance to plot our next great escape (from the scoreboard, of course).
